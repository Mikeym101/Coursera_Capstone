    "Moving to a new place to for a job is hard, having to relocate with a young family creates additional concerns and considerations that have to be factored in. Choosing where to live when you arrive in a new place is one of the most important decisions, and usually you know little to nothing about the city, services, transportation, demographics etc. Making a bad choice at this stage can result in long commutes, resentment about the job and an unhappy social/family life. I will seek to utilise publicly available data and data science skills to attempt to answer the question, Where is the best location for me and my family to live?\n",

    "Singapore has a wealth of publicly available government data on their website https://data.gov.sg. I have mined this to get the geoJSON data for their neighbourhoods, or planning areas as they call them. This splits Singapore into 55 areas, and I will use a library called <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/\">Shapely</a> to find the centroid location coordinates of each area. From those I will utilise the <a href=\"https://foursquare.com\">FourSquare</a> API to search for venues within each area that are related to children, kids and babies. In the <a href=\"https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/resources/categories\">Developer Categories list</a> I have found many venue types that are related to or would be of interest to parents with young children, including playgrounds, parks, baby shops etc. The full list of IDs will be described in the methodology later. \n",
